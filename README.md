# generic_tools

Just a basic functional stuff I reuse in many of my projects (thankfully it's implementable now with the advent of generics).
I think anyone who is familiar with something as functional as Python will appreciate these tools â€“ if had not implemented them already for themselves.

Thinking of more handy type interfacing, but for now that's WIP.
