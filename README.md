# generic_tools

Just basic functional stuff I reuse in many of my projects (thankfully it's implementable now with the advent of generics).
I think anyone who is familiar with something as functional as Python will appreciate these tools (if not had implemented them already for themselves).

Thinking of more handy type interfacing, for not that'd WIP.
